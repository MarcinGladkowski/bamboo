Here are my five tasks and questions for you:

* Read the monthly-price data into a data frame from the first tab of the Excel file. Ensure that there is a date column based on the first column,
which contains a four-digit year, the letter M, and then a two-digit month. Make that the index. 
The columns should have the textual names, but not the measures from the row under them.
Make sure all columns are numeric.

 * Using Seaborn, plot the price of cocao during each month over the last five years.
Have the plot include a dot for each data point, and label the axes as well as the plot itself. 
Does the graph show that prices have increased dramatically? Have they come down at all recently?
